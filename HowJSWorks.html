        // Important thing to remember . Will also help in async and sync Js
        // V8 engine in chrome helps to run JS. Every browser has an engine of its own. This engine converts our JS to machine (binary) lang. Also it manages memory and call stack
        //The functions that are called get added into call stack. Also, the stack fills accordingly,If the work of function gets done it gets free from call stack. JS has only one call stack (Java is multi threaded as it has more than one call stack)
        //JS is a single threaded that can be non blocking. JS is blocking language by nature (functions stored as block in Call stack) but it can be made non blocking using async JS
